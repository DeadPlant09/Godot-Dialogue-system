Hello! and thak you for testing my dialouge system.
I know its seem not impressive (especaily the json) but this is a project 
where I didnt strictly follow a spisifc tutorial, so im sharing this with you
in case you wanted to a) use a prexisting dialouge system that you can change the code of
or b) take insperation from this dialouge system to build your own, etiher or is great!

well anyway heres how it works:
	all dialouge are held in a converstion array
	given a string number, these conversation being 
	held in a giant dictanary making the json itself 
	the every dialouge line is in the form of a 
	dictionary, each line has at least 2 keys the name
	and a text (self exsplanatory), there are more
	optional keys that i call options there is     
	Skipable:bool if turned off doent allow you to skip the text
	Sound: bool if turned off the dialouge sound wont be played
	auto_skip: bool if turned on then when the dialouge line has fully ran it will automaticly skip to the next one
	pause_at_ending_of_sentence:bool if on for then it wont stop a puntuions 
	just_show_text:bool if true then the character profile/icon wont show up jus there voice
	Reaction:String if you type a string into a Reaction key then it will slide in as a tiny blub on the dialogue box
