Hello! and thak you for testing my dialouge system.
I know its seem not impressive (especaily the json) but this is a project 
where I didnt strictly follow a spisifc tutorial, so im sharing this with you
in case you wanted to a) use a prexisting dialouge system that you can change the code of
or b) take insperation from this dialouge system to build your own, etiher or is great!

well anyway heres how it works:
	all dialogue is held in a converstion array given a string number, these conversation being 
	held in a giant dictanary making the json itself 
	the every dialouge line is in the form of a 
	dictionary, each line has at least 2 keys the name
	and a text (self exsplanatory), there are more optional keys that i call options there is:     
	
	"Text": string the message you want to display
	"Name": string the name of the profile
	"Face": int  the animation for the profile you want to play (only use if the profile has an animation)
	"volume": float determines the volume 
	"can move": bool if true allows you to move when dialogues being shown
	"skipable": bool if false doent allow you to skip the text
	"voice": bool if false the dialouge sound wont be played
	"auto skip": bool if true then when when the dialouge line has fully ran it will automaticly skip to the next one
	"Reactions": array if you type a string into a Reaction key then it will slide in as a tiny blurb on the dialogue box
	"pause at ending": bool if on for then it wont stop a puntuions 
	"just text": bool if true then the profile/icon and dialogue box wont show up just the text
	"hide profile": bool if true then the profile/icon wont show up
	"pause": array put the index of the character you want to stop at (spaces count to)
	"hide name": bool if true will hide the name 
	"emit custom": array put down a true if you want the signal to play when the dialogue is shown and the string of an already existing singal from the dialogue system script
	"wait signal finshed": bool if true when emitning a signal it will wait for the singal action to be complete before showing the dialogue   
	"Choices": array a list of stings that wil show up as choices
	"Responses": array the lists of conversation you can respond to depending on the choice
	"Aftermath": array the lists of conversation they could say after the responce depending on the choice
	"text_2": string put down text for the sceond dialogue box 
	"name_2": string put down the profile name for the sceond dialogue box
	"face_2": int put down the profile animation for the sceond dialogue box 
	"Responses 2": array depending on diffrent conditions this is used to give a diffrent responce to the same choice 
	"Aftermath 2": array depending on diffrent conditions this is used to give a diffrent aftermath to the same choice 
	


Necessary files to bring to you projects
	diauloge systerm.tscn/.gd
	dialougue_area.tscn/.gd
	npc_body.tscn/.gd
	cutscene trigger.tscn/.gd
	make sure your player stops moving when Diauloge_Systerm is Deactivated and not Diauloge_Systerm can_move is false
	and your own main.json in the same format as mines
	lastly if you dont have your own font you can bring the stary font

Before you run
	make the Diauloge_Systerm scene a singleton (global)
	set the Diauloge_Systerm Icon path to the folder where your dialogue icons are
	set the Diauloge_Systerm voice path to the folder where your dialogue voices are
	if your game already has a script that saves make it global, try and add the cutscene_ran value to it
	make sure all your animations are between the time intrvals of 0 - 0.05 to be precice 0.025
